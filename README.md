This is a tree chart representing the big screen of the migration between frameworks. The intention is basically show the process by routes.

### How to generate the chart
1. Use [this](https://gist.github.com/epartipilo/eb112349ded169b309b55182b968004b) snippet to get the JSON file of your Angular ui-state from the browser developer console while running the application
1. Modify the already existing JSON structure on the _index.html_ file. Note that actually we have three nodes (Angular, Vue, Progress)  

### Nice to have

- Each main node to a different color or show the framework logo
- Read JSON an external JSON file
- Generate the Vue nodes dynamically
- Make the page more corporate for future presentations
